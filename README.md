# October 2016 - 'Horror' Source

## Description
- The core source code from a hex-tile-based minigame I designed and built in 2016 while working for Loot Crate.
- Design, development, coding, and implementation all done by me.
- Art assets created by Zack Finfrock

## Background
- With the crate theme being 'horror' (and me not being a fan of the horror genre in any way), I leaned into classic 'Halloween' imagery and made a tile-based matching game.
- I had a lot of ideas concepted out for how to make the tiles behave, but many of them didn't make it in time for launch. Commented code for other attempts have been left in place
- Total development time from concept to launch was 5 weeks.
- This code is not fully functional without the rest of the Unity project, and is only being provided here as reference.
- Fully Unity source code is available on request.
